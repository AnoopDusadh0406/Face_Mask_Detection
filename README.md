# Face_Mask_Detection
Developed a project where model can predict any individual person wear a mask or not or wear but incorrectly. 


# Overview

Using Machine Learning concepts to design  models that can determine whether an individual is wearing a face mask 
or not   or wearing but incorrectly.

# Dataset
This are the dataset wear face mask and not wear face mask
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset

This dataset  is wear face mask but incorrectly.  This dataset too large so only use 00-05.

# Results

Naive Bayes :   
 Naive bayes work upon assumption and how much pixels correlate with each other, it performed with ~68% for multinomial and ~77% for Gaussian.

Decision Tree:    
 The optimal parameters resulted in 84% accuracy.

SVM :  
Reached an accuracy of ~92% with our testing dataset.


CNN :    
 Reached an accuracy of ~97% with our testing data.
